# Data and Telecommunication
Developed a 2D parity bit stream converter to encode (client) and decode (server) it into Manchester Scheme. To detect whether there is an error or not. I also have created a random error generator to check whether the server can detect error transmitted data. And also used python socket programming to transmit data to server from client. Please use the input text file "inputBitStream.txt" to convert the bit stream to 2D parity bit stream and also for encoding, decoding and error detection. All the outputs are saved in separated output files too.
