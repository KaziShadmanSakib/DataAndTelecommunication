# Data and Telecommunication
All the assignments given in my Data and Telecommunication course. Includes several encoders and decoders of DIGITAL-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION techniques like Line Coding (several types of Line Coding) and Scrambling (several types of Scrambling) till now. I will be uploading more until the course ends. All the encoders and decoders are made from scratch using C++ Programming Language. Please read each "README.md" files in the practical named files before you use any encoder or decoder.
